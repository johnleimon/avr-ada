\chapter{Introduction}

The \AVRThreadsLibrary provides basic preemptive multi-threading to
the \Atmel \AVR family of microcontrollers.  It is written mostly in C
with some assembly language.  It implements a simple round-robin style
task switcher.

This library provides basic thread start and stop functions, a couple
of flavors of mutual exclusion semaphore, and events to help
synchronize threads.

I have released this code under the
\urlh{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html}{GNU Lesser General
  Public License} with the hope that others might find it useful.

\chapter{Build and Installation}

To build and install the \AVRThreadsLibrary, you need to have already
installed the \AVRGCC cross-compiler.

\section{Build}
\index{building from source}

To install the \AVRThreadsLibrary, unpack the source tree.  If you
downloaded the \lit{*.tgz} version, you can do this with the following
command:
\begin{displayc}
  tar -xzf threads-1.3-src.tgz
\end{displayc}

Next, change directory to the head of the source tree that was just
unpacked and run the \code{make} command:
\begin{displayc}
  $ cd threads-1.3
  $ make
\end{displayc}
This should build the \AVRThreadsLibrary for all the supported \AVR
microcontrollers.

\section{Installation}
\index{installation}

Once the libraries have been successfully built, you need to install
the library components to a location where the \AVRGCC compiler can
find them.

The default installation directory prefix is \code{/usr/local}.  If
you wish to change this, you will have to edit the \code{src/Makefile}
file in the source tree.  In the Makefile, you'll find a line that
looks like this:
\begin{displayc}
  prefix = /usr/local
\end{displayc}
Change this line to desired directory prefix. For example, if you're
using \urlh{http://winavr.sourceforge.net/}{\WinAVR}, you will need to
change this this point to where \WinAVR has been installed.  For
example, if \WinAVR has been installed in \verb{c:\WinAVR}, then
change the prefix line to this:
\begin{displayc}
  prefix = c:/WinAVR
\end{displayc}

Finally, from the head of the source tree, or from the \code{src}
directory, run this:
\begin{displayc}
  \$ make install
\end{displayc}

\chapter{Basic Functions and Structures}

\section{Initializing the Library}

\subsection{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_init(void)}{function}{avr_thread_init()}

This function initializes the \AVRThreadsLibrary.  It must be called
before any other \AVRThreadsLibrary function is called.

This function sets up a default context so that it can treat the
currently running program as a thread.  It also prepares the ``idle''
thread that runs when no other thread can run.  After calling this
function, task switches can occur, both implicit and explicit.

\section{Starting, Stopping, and Pausing Threads}

\subsection{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_start(avr_thread_context* context, void (*fn)(void), uint8_t* stack, uint16_t stack_size)}{function}{avr_thread_start()}

This function starts a new thread of execution given a pointer to a
\structref{avr_thread_context}, \argument{context}; a pointer to a
function where the thread will begin execution, \argument{fn}; a
pointer to a stack, \argument{stack}; and the size of the stack,
\argument{stack_size}.

The memory pointed to by \argument{context} must remain valid
throughout the life of the new thread.

The stack space provided must also remain valid throughout the life of
the new thread.  The stack for each thread must be large enough to
satisfy the stack needs of the thread's code, plus enough additional
space to hold the entire register state at the time of a task switch.

\function{void avr_thread_stop(void)}{function}{avr_thread_stop()}

This function stops the current thread.  It does this by taking the
current thread out of the task list and forcing a task switch.

\function{void avr_thread_sleep(uint16_t ticks)}{function}{avr_thread_sleep()}

This function places the given thread to sleep for the given number of
task-switcher ticks, \argument{ticks}.  The thread automatically
awakens after the given time has elapsed.

Passing zero to this function forces a task switch and is equivalent
to calling \funref{avr_thread_yield()}.

\function{void avr_thread_yield(void)}{inline}{avr_thread_yield()}

This function forces an explicit task-switch away from the current
thread.  It is implemented by calling \funref{avr_thread_sleep()} with
an argument of zero.

\section{Task Switcher}

The library needs the help of a timer interrupt and its \ISR to
provide preemptive multitasking.  The following two functions are
designed to be called from within an \ISR tagged with the \lit{naked}
compiler attribute.  For example, here is the \ISR for TIMER2 on the
\Atmel ATmega128 microcontroller:
\begin{verbatim}
void SIG_OUTPUT_COMPARE2(void) __attribute__((naked));
void SIG_OUTPUT_COMPARE2(void)
{
    /* Global interrupt can be re-enabled here if desired. */
    /* sei(); */
    avr_thread_isr_start();
    /* Place your normal ISR code here. */
    /* ... */
    /* This must be the last function called. */
    avr_thread_isr_end();
}
\end{verbatim}
Also, here is an example configuration of TIMER2 that yields
approximately 1kHz preemptive task switch frequency with a 16MHz
crystal:
\begin{verbatim}
    /* ... */
    /* Setup TIMER2 mode.  Include reset on overflow bit. */
    /* Approximately 1 kHz for a 16 MHz crystal. */
    TCCR2 = _BV(WGM21) | _BV(CS21) | _BV(CS20);
    OCR2 = 250;
    TCNT2 = 0;
    TIMSK |= _BV(OCIE2);
    /* Initialize library. */
    avr_thread_init();
    /* Enable global interrupts to start preemptive task switching */
    sei();
    /* ... */
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_isr_start(void)}{function}{avr_thread_isr_start()}

Call this function at the beginning of the interrupt service routine
used to provide the preemptive multitasking.  This function saves
registers on the stack in preparation for a task switch.  The \ISR
must be declared with the attribute "naked".

If you want to run your \ISR code with global interrupts enabled,
place a call to \code{sei()} just before this function.  No other code
should be placed ahead of the call to \thisfunction since this will
disturb the thread context before this function has a chance to save
it.

\function{void avr_thread_isr_end(void)}{function}{avr_thread_isr_end()}

Call this function at the end of the interrupt service routine used to
provide the preemptive multitasking.  This function does not return.

\chapter{Thread Synchronization}

The \AVRThreadsLibrary provides two basic ways to synchronize threads:
mutual exclusion semaphores\index{mutual exclusion semaphores}
(mutexes\index{mutexes}) and events\index{events}.

\section{Mutexes}\index{mutexes}\label{mutexes}

Mutual exclusion semaphores, or mutexes, provide a way to ensure that
only one thread is executing a particular piece of code at a time.

The mutexes described here keep track of ownership and lock counts.
This allows a thread to lock a mutex a number of times in the code
path without having to worry about the thread blocking.  Also, threads
that are blocked on these mutexes are awakened in the order that they
blocked so that the thread that has been waiting the longest will be
awakened when the mutex become available.

\subsection{Functions}

\function{uint8_t avr_thread_mutex_gain(volatile avr_thread_mutex* mutex, uint16_t ticks)}{function}{avr_thread_mutex_gain()}

This function tries to gain ownership of the given mutex,
\argument{mutex}.

If the mutex is unlocked, the current thread locks the mutex and
thereby gains ownership of the mutex, and this function returns
\result{1} immediately.

If the mutex is already locked and owned by the current thread, the
lock-count is incremented and the function returns \result{1}
immediately.

If the mutex is already locked and owned by another thread, this
thread blocks until the mutex becomes available or until the given
number of ticks, \argument{ticks}, have elapsed.  If the thread
successfully locks the mutex before the number of ticks have elapsed,
the function return \result{1}.  Otherwise, the function times-out and
returns \result{0}.  If the thread blocks and you have passed
\argument{ticks} as zero, the function will wait indefinitely until
the mutex becomes available.

\function{void avr_thread_mutex_release(volatile avr_thread_mutex* mutex)}{function}{avr_thread_mutex_release()}

This function releases the given mutex. The mutex is not really
released until this function is called the same number of times as the
\funref{avr_thread_mutex_gain()} function was called in locking the
mutex.

If multiple threads are waiting on this mutex, the thread that has
been waiting the longest is released.

\structure{struct avr_thread_mutex}{structure}{avr_thread_mutex}

This structure is used by the \AVRThreadsLibrary to hold mutex data.

\section{Basic Mutexes}\index{mutexes, basic}\label{basic mutexes}

Basic mutexes are very simple and lack some important features of the
regular mutexes (see \ref{mutexes}).  While the advantage of basic
mutexes is their execution-speed and a smaller code and memory
foot-print, you should exercise care in using them since they do not
keep track of ownership or lock counts.  For example, if a thread
locks a basic mutex and tries to lock it again, the thread will block.

\subsection{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_mutex_basic_gain(volatile avr_thread_mutex_basic* mutex)}{function}{avr_thread_mutex_basic_gain()}

This function tries to lock the given basic mutex, \argument{mutex}.
If the mutex is already locked, the thread blocks on the basic-mutex
waiting for another thread to release the lock on the thread.

A thread that has called \thisfunction should not call it again without first releasing the lock with \funref{avr_thread_mutex_basic_release()}.

\function{uint8_t avr_thread_mutex_basic_test_and_gain(volatile avr_thread_mutex_basic* mutex)}{function}{avr_thread_mutex_basic_test_and_gain()}

This function tries to lock the given basic mutex, \argument{mutex}.
If it is not already locked by another thread, the mutex is locked and
the function returns \result{1}.  If it is already locked by another
thread, the function does not block but instead returns \result{0}
immediately.

\function{void avr_thread_mutex_basic_release(volatile avr_thread_mutex_basic* mutex)}{function}{avr_thread_mutex_basic_release()}

This function releases the lock on the given basic mutex,
\argument{mutex}.

\structure{struct avr_thread_mutex_basic}{structure}{avr_thread_mutex_basic}

This structure is used by the \AVRThreadsLibrary to hold basic mutex
data.  \treatasopaque

\chapter{Events}\index{events}

\newcommand{\whilesignaled} {While the event is signaled, a thread
  that calls \funref{avr_thread_event_wait()} or
  \funref{avr_thread_event_wait_and_clear()} will return immediately.}

Events provide a way to signal to other threads that an event has
occurred.

\section{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_event_set_wake_one(volatile avr_thread_event* event)}{function}{avr_thread_event_set_wake_one()}

This function places the given event, \argument{event} in a signaled
state.  If there are threads waiting on this event, the thread that
has been waiting the longest is awakened.

\whilesignaled

\function{void avr_thread_event_set_wake_all(volatile avr_thread_event* event)}{function}{avr_thread_event_set_wake_all()}

This function places the given event, \argument{event} in a signaled
state.  If there are threads waiting on this event, all of them are
awakened.

\whilesignaled 

\function{void avr_thread_event_clear(volatile avr_thread_event* event)}{function}{avr_thread_event_clear()}

This function clears the given event, \argument{event}.  While the
event is clear, a thread that calls \funref{avr_thread_event_wait()}
or \funref{avr_thread_event_wait_and_clear()} will block until the
event is signaled.

\function{uint8_t avr_thread_event_wait(volatile avr_thread_event* event, uint16_t ticks)}{function}{avr_thread_event_wait()}

This function waits for the given event, \argument{event}, to become
signaled.

If the event is signaled when this function is called, this function
returns \result{1} immediately.  Otherwise, the thread is blocked
until the event is signaled by another thread.

While blocked, if the thread is awakened by another thread through a
call to \funref{avr_thread_event_set_wake_all()} or
\funref{avr_thread_event_set_wake_one()}, then this function returns
\result{1}.  Otherwise, if the given number of ticks,
\argument{ticks}, elapses, the function times-out and returns
\result{0}.

If you pass \argument{ticks} as zero, this function will wait
indefinitely until the event becomes signaled.

\function{uint8_t avr_thread_event_wait_and_clear(volatile avr_thread_event* event, uint16_t ticks)}{function}{avr_thread_event_wait_and_clear()}

This function waits for the given event, \argument{event}, to become
signaled.

If the event is signaled when this function is called, this function
clears the event and returns \result{1} immediately.  Otherwise, the
thread is blocked until the event is signaled by another thread.

While blocked, if the thread is awakened by another thread through a
call to \funref{avr_thread_event_set_wake_all()} or
\funref{avr_thread_event_set_wake_one()}, then this function clears
the event and returns \result{1}.  Otherwise, if the given number of
ticks, \argument{ticks}, elapses, the function times-out and returns
\result{0}.

If you pass \argument{ticks} as zero, this function will wait
indefinitely until the event becomes signaled.

\structure{struct avr_thread_event}{structure}{avr_thread_event}

This structure is used by the \AVRThreadsLibrary to hold event data.

\chapter{Additional Functions and Structures}

\newcommand{\avrthreadenabledisablepairing}
{The \funref{avr_thread_enable()} and \funref{avr_thread_disable()}
  functions keep track of how many times they've been called.  Task
  switching will only be enabled when \funref{avr_thread_enable()} has
  been called as many times as \funref{avr_thread_disable()} was
  called in disabling task switching.}

\section{Functions}

\function{void avr_thread_enable(void)}{inline}{avr_thread_enable()}

This function re-enables task switching that has been disabled by
\funref{avr_thread_disable()}.

\avrthreadenabledisablepairing

\function{void avr_thread_disable(void)}{inline}{avr_thread_disable()}

This function disables task switching.  Task switching is re-enabled
by calling \funref{avr_thread_enable()}.

\avrthreadenabledisablepairing

\structure{struct avr_thread_context}{structure}{avr_thread_context}

This structure holds data used by the \AVRThreadsLibrary to manage
each thread.  \treatasopaque
